# Laboratory Activity #1: Working with Digital Signals

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a **LED Running Light** circuit using an Arduino microcontroller. This activity demonstrates the control of digital signals and sequential logic in an embedded system.

## 🎯 Objectives
* Review **Arduino** as a platform for IoT systems implementation.
* Implement and manage **digital signals** within a physical circuit.
* Master the use of `digitalWrite()` and timing functions for automated hardware control.

## 🛠️ Instructions & Requirements

### 1. Circuit Logic
The goal is to create a "Running Light" sequence using five LEDs connected to **Pins 8 through 12**.
* **Direction:** The sequence flows from Pin 12 down to Pin 8.
* **On Phase:** Turn all LEDs ON one by one (1-second delay between each).
* **Off Phase:** Turn all LEDs OFF one by one (1-second delay between each).
* **Command:** All pins must be controlled using the `digitalWrite()` function.



### 2. Submission Requirements
The final GitHub repository must contain:
* The Arduino Sketch file (`.ino`).
* A professional Breadboard Diagram (TinkerCad or Fritzing).
* A document listing the individual grades/contributions of the members.
